Point 1 = EDV and end diastolic pressure
Point 2 = Aortic pressure is encountered here as the heart contracts to isovolumetric pressure. This is where the aortic valve opens
Point 3 = ESV
Point 4 = Same volume, pressure drops

<strong><em>Stroke volume is the difference between points 2 and 3</em></strong>.

Blood pressure is <strong>below</strong> the normal range. This is due to the <strong>reduced stroke volume</strong> where there is a reduced venous return, and so smaller preload/EDV and less contractility, causing a decreased cardiac output and decreased blood pressure.

 	<li>Although points 2 and 3 do move closer together as stroke volume decreases as preload increases, points 1 and 2 also move closer together. Due to this, this option is not the most appropriate answer out of the options given.</li>
 	<li>Correct as all 4 points move closer together, meaning that the whole pressure-volume loop becomes smaller</li>
 	<li>Point 1 would move slightly to the left as reduced blood pressure implies that there is also less venous return so the EDV would fall below the normal range.</li>

Atrial systole is where the atria contract to top off the blood that has already flown passively through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. Atrial contraction completes before ventricles start contracting due to the pause caused by the atrioventricular node.
<ol>
 	<li>An abnormal heart sound called S4 typically occurs during atrial systole with pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure and tricuspid incompetence. Although not very likely, atrial systole causes S4 if a patient presents with tricuspid incompetence as the blood hitting the ventricle that comes from the ventricle is exaggerated.</li>
 	<li>An increased jugular pulse occurs during ventricular systole and can usually be a sign of right ventricular failure.</li>
 	<li>This statement is too vague where it would depend on what lead the P wave would be large. Lead II, lead III and lead aVF only would have a bigger P wave [you are not expected to know what the ECG leads looks like for tricuspid regurgitation! This is just included for your understanding as to why this option is incorrect.]</li>
 	<li>T wave would be present on all ECG leads regardless of tricuspid incompetence.</li>
 	<li>Ventricular gallop is a S3 that is heard during rapid ventricular filling usually due to severe hypertension or mitral incompetence.</li>
</ol>
The two normal heart sounds are S1 and S2. S1 is the first heart sound that occurs when the AV valves are closing during isovolumic contraction and S2 is the second heart sound that occurs when the pulmonary and aortic valves shut during isovolumic relaxation.

<strong>Type of disturbance – acidosis/alkalosis (1/2 mark)
Aetiology – respiratory/metabolic (1 mark)
Compensation – full/partial/uncompensated (1/2 mark)
Patient C – accept either </strong><strong>metabolic acidosis </strong><strong>OR </strong><strong>respiratory alkalosis </strong>

<strong>Patient A</strong> has a high pH, which indicates an alkalosis. The PaCO2 is normal, while the HCO3- and BE are high, which suggests that the cause of this disturbance is metabolic. In this case, the PaCO2 has not yet started to compensate for the high bicarbonate conc. – the disturbance is, therefore, uncompensated.

Note that if it was partially compensated, the PaCO2 would have been high.

In case of <strong>patient B</strong>, the pH is low, which indicates an acidosis, while PaCO2 and BE are both high. An excess of CO2 has likely made the blood pH acidic, while the bicarbonate concentration has increased to compensate for that drop in pH. Because the pH is still low, it suggests a partial compensation – it means that the compensatory mechanism is still trying to bring the pH to normal.

Note that if this was a metabolic acidosis, both PaCO2 and BE would be low – the patient would hyperventilate in order to compensate for the insufficient bicarbonate. But because PaCO2 and HCO3 values are high despite pH being acidic, it indicates partial compensation for an acid-base disturbance of respiratory aetiology.

<strong>Patient C’s</strong> case is trickier, because their blood pH is normal despite low PaCO2 and BE, which suggests that the acid-base disturbance has been fully compensated for. But it is difficult to distinguish from the ABG results alone whether this patient had a respiratory alkalosis compensated for by a decrease in bicarbonate conc., OR a metabolic acidosis compensated for by a decrease in PaCO2 (hyperventilation).

In the case of fully compensated metabolic acidosis (patient C), the pH tends to be in the normal pH range. When you look at the PaCO2, you notice that it is high (acidic), but the HCO3/Base excess is also high, indicating that the body has compensated and neutralised the high CO2 by increasing HCO3-.
